# Capitalism html5 game clone

## Structure

- Separate web and server folder.

### WEB

1. Choose plain js and html to build game. Instead of using any framework.
  - Why no framework: This is my first game developing and `Capitalism` seems has quite few animations. So I feel it doesn't necessary to consider performance of canvas. And I could progressively adopt canvas in rendering. And as it is 9 to 16 hours time limited project, learning new framework and debugging in new environments are burden for me.
2. Choose TS to prevent small mistakes.
